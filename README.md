#  MicroSaaS-Sentinel (V1.0)

**MicroSaaS-Sentinel** is a specialized financial monitoring engine designed for small businesses and micro-SaaS models. This project bridges the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making.


##  The Vision
In early-stage business operations, understanding financial health is often manual and error-prone. Sentinel automates the calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide real-time clarity on profitability and scalability.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture (MVP)
Built with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and clean code principles:
* **Logic Core:** Python-based engine for financial modeling.
* **OOP Design:** Implements modular classes for scalable business logic.
* **Financial Indicators:** Automated Net Profit, Margin Analysis, and Health Status reporting.

##  Business Value
* **Efficiency:** Reduces the time spent on manual accounting spreadsheets.
* **Clarity:** Instant "Healthy/Warning" status based on profit margins.
* **Future-Ready:** Designed to integrate with payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal) in future versions.
